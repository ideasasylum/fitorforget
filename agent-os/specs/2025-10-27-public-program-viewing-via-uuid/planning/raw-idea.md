# Raw Idea: Public Program Viewing via UUID

**Roadmap Item:** #4

## Feature Description

- Allow users to share their workout programs publicly via a UUID link
- Anyone with the UUID link can view the program (no authentication required)
- Public view should show program title, exercises, and descriptions
- Should be a clean, read-only view optimized for sharing
- Programs use UUID routing which is already implemented

## Context

This is part of the "Fit or Forget" Rails 8 application which already has:
- WebAuthn passwordless authentication
- Exercise Program CRUD with UUID-based routing
- Exercise Management within programs with markdown descriptions
- Turbo Frames for seamless interactions
