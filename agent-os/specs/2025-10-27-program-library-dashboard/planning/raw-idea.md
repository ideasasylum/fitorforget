# Raw Feature Idea

## Roadmap Item #8: Program Library & Dashboard

### Feature Description
Build user dashboard displaying all programs they've created (with edit/delete actions) and programs they've followed (with quick access to start new session). Implement basic filtering and sorting by recent activity.

### Core Functionality
This is the dashboard/home page feature where:
- Users see all their created programs
- Can edit/delete programs
- Can start workouts from programs
- Basic filtering and sorting
- Quick access to recent activity
- Mobile-first design

### Technical Context
- Rails 8 application with Turbo, Stimulus, Tailwind CSS
- Existing Program and Workout models
- Programs already have index page at /programs
- Workouts already have index page at /workouts
- WebAuthn authentication
- Mobile-first design with 44x44px touch targets
