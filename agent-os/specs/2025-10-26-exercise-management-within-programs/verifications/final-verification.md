## 8. Conclusion

The Exercise Management within Programs feature has been successfully implemented and verified. All acceptance criteria are met, all tests pass, and the implementation follows Rails and Turbo best practices. The feature is production-ready with comprehensive test coverage, proper authorization, mobile-first responsive design, and seamless user experience through Turbo Frames and Streams.

**Recommendation:** Feature is ready for deployment. The only minor issue is missing implementation documentation reports, which do not affect the quality or completeness of the code implementation itself.
