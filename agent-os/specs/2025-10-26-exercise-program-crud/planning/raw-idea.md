# Exercise Program CRUD - Raw Feature Idea

**Roadmap Item:** #2
**Complexity:** Medium (M)
**Date Initiated:** 2025-10-26

## Feature Description

Build the core Program model and controller with full CRUD operations. Users can create, edit, view, and delete exercise programs. Each program includes title, description, and UUID generation for sharing.

## Context from Roadmap

- This is the second item in the roadmap, building on top of the completed WebAuthn authentication system
- Users are already authenticated via WebAuthn (roadmap item 1 - complete)
- Programs will have a belongs_to :user relationship
- Each program needs: title, description, UUID for sharing
- Full CRUD operations required: Create, Read, Update, Delete

## Technical Context

### Existing Stack
- Rails 8 application
- Using Tailwind CSS for styling
- Turbo Frames for seamless navigation
- Stimulus for JavaScript interactions
- SQLite database
- Mobile-first responsive design
- WebAuthn authentication already implemented

### Requirements Summary

**Model Requirements:**
- Program model with belongs_to :user association
- Fields: title, description, UUID (for sharing)
- UUID generation on creation

**Controller Requirements:**
- Full CRUD operations:
  - Create: New program form and creation logic
  - Read: View individual program, list all user's programs
  - Update: Edit program form and update logic
  - Delete: Destroy program with confirmation

**User Experience:**
- Users can create new exercise programs
- Users can edit their existing programs
- Users can view their programs (individual and list view)
- Users can delete programs they own
- Programs can be shared via UUID

## Dependencies

- WebAuthn authentication (roadmap item #1) - COMPLETE
- User model and authentication system must be in place

## Next Steps

Proceed to requirements research phase to define:
- Detailed data model specifications
- Controller actions and routes
- View templates and UI/UX design
- Sharing mechanism via UUID
- Authorization rules (users can only modify their own programs)
- Validation rules for program attributes
