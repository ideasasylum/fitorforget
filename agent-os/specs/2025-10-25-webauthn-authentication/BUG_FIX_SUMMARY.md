# Critical Bug Fix: Case-Insensitive Email Authentication

## Issue Reported

The user reported: **"The system is registering the same user over and over rather than allowing them to sign in."**

## Root Cause Analysis

The authentication system was using **case-sensitive** email lookups when checking if a user exists. This caused the following problem:

1. User registers with email: "user@example.com"
2. User returns and enters: "User@Example.com" (different casing)
3. System performs case-sensitive lookup: `User.find_by(email: "User@Example.com")`
4. Lookup fails to find the existing user (SQLite is case-sensitive by default)
5. System thinks this is a NEW user and attempts to register them again
6. Registration fails with duplicate email error OR creates confusion

## Technical Details

### Problem Code (Before Fix)

**SessionsController#check (Line 21):**
```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: email)
```

**SessionsController#handle_authentication (Line 144):**
```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: email)
```

**Issue:** `find_by` performs case-sensitive lookups in SQLite, so "user@example.com" != "User@Example.com"

### Solution Implemented

**1. User Model - Email Normalization:**
```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
before_validation :normalize_email

def normalize_email
  self.email = email.downcase.strip if email.present?
end
```

**2. User Model - Case-Insensitive Lookup Method:**
```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
def self.find_by_email(email)
  return nil if email.blank?
  normalized_email = email.downcase.strip
  where("LOWER(email) = ?", normalized_email).first
end
```

**3. SessionsController - Use Case-Insensitive Lookup:**
```ruby
# Line 22 in check action
user = User.find_by_email(email)

# Line 145 in handle_authentication method
user = User.find_by_email(email)
```

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/jamie/code/fitorforget/app/models/user.rb`
   - Added `before_validation :normalize_email` callback
   - Added `self.find_by_email(email)` class method

2. `/Users/jamie/code/fitorforget/app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb`
   - Line 22: Changed to `User.find_by_email(email)`
   - Line 145: Changed to `User.find_by_email(email)`

3. `/Users/jamie/code/fitorforget/test/models/user_test.rb`
   - Added 5 new tests validating email normalization and case-insensitive lookups

4. `/Users/jamie/code/fitorforget/test/integration/authentication_flows_test.rb`
   - Added 12 integration tests including 2 specifically testing the bug fix

## Test Coverage

### Tests Validating the Fix

**Integration Tests:**
- `test_full_login_flow_authenticates_existing_user_with_case-insensitive_email`
  - Creates user with "existing@example.com"
  - Attempts login with "Existing@Example.com"
  - Verifies system recognizes as existing user (not new registration)

- `test_case-insensitive_email_lookup_prevents_duplicate_user_registrations`
  - Creates user with "user@example.com"
  - Attempts auth check with "USER@EXAMPLE.COM"
  - Verifies no new user created
  - Verifies authentication challenge generated (not registration)

**Model Tests:**
- `test_user_model_normalizes_email_to_lowercase_before_saving`
  - Creates user with "Test@Example.COM"
  - Verifies email stored as "test@example.com"

- `test_find_by_email_finds_users_regardless_of_email_case`
  - Creates user with "test@example.com"
  - Finds with "TEST@EXAMPLE.COM"
  - Verifies same user found

### Total Test Suite
- **36 tests - ALL PASSING ✓**
- User Model: 12 tests
- Credential Model: 7 tests
- SessionsController: 5 tests
- Integration Tests: 12 tests

## Behavior After Fix

### Registration Flow
1. User enters: "User@Example.com"
2. Email normalized to: "user@example.com" (before validation)
3. Email saved in database as: "user@example.com"
4. User created successfully

### Login Flow (Same User)
1. User enters: "USER@EXAMPLE.COM" (any casing)
2. System normalizes to: "user@example.com"
3. Case-insensitive lookup finds existing user
4. **Authentication challenge generated (NOT registration)**
5. User signs in successfully

### Multi-Device Registration (Same User)
1. User already exists with "user@example.com"
2. On new device, enters: "User@Example.Com"
3. System recognizes existing user (case-insensitive)
4. Prompts for biometric authentication
5. After successful auth, can register new device credential

## Security Impact

### Positive Security Improvements
- ✓ Prevents duplicate accounts through case variation
- ✓ Prevents user confusion and support issues
- ✓ Consistent email handling across the system
- ✓ Defense against social engineering (claiming different email casing)
- ✓ Better user experience (users don't need to remember exact casing)

### No Negative Security Impact
- Email normalization is a security best practice
- Case-insensitive lookups don't weaken authentication
- All other security measures remain intact (WebAuthn, sessions, etc.)

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Performance Cost
- `before_validation` callback adds negligible overhead
- `WHERE LOWER(email) = ?` query is efficient
- Email column already indexed
- SQLite handles LOWER() function efficiently

### Recommendation for Production
If performance becomes a concern at scale, consider:
1. Adding a functional index on `LOWER(email)` in database
2. Storing emails pre-normalized (already done with callback)
3. Using parameterized queries (already done)

## Deployment Notes

### Breaking Changes
**NONE** - This is a backward-compatible fix.

Existing users can continue to sign in with any casing of their email. No data migration needed.

### Database Impact
No schema changes required. The fix works with existing database structure.

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise, simply revert the two modified files:
1. `app/models/user.rb`
2. `app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb`

## User Impact

### Before Fix
- Users who registered with "user@example.com" but tried to login with "User@Example.com" would:
  - See registration flow instead of login flow
  - Get confused about why they can't sign in
  - Potentially create duplicate account attempts
  - Contact support for help

### After Fix
- Users can enter their email in ANY casing:
  - "user@example.com"
  - "User@Example.com"
  - "USER@EXAMPLE.COM"
  - "uSeR@eXaMpLe.CoM"
- All variations correctly identify the same user
- Consistent authentication experience
- No user confusion

## Validation Checklist

- ✓ Bug identified and root cause analyzed
- ✓ Fix implemented in User model and SessionsController
- ✓ 36 tests written and passing
- ✓ Integration tests specifically validate the fix
- ✓ Security implications reviewed and documented
- ✓ Performance impact assessed (minimal)
- ✓ No breaking changes introduced
- ✓ Documentation created (TESTING.md, SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md)

## Next Steps

### Required Manual Testing
Users should manually test on actual devices to confirm:
1. Register with "user@example.com"
2. Logout
3. Login with "User@Example.com" (different casing)
4. Verify successful authentication (not registration)
5. Test on iOS Safari, Android Chrome, and desktop

See `TESTING.md` for comprehensive manual testing checklist.

### Production Deployment
Ready to deploy. No special deployment steps required.

## Conclusion

This critical bug has been **FIXED and VALIDATED**. Users can now sign in with any casing of their email address, and the system correctly recognizes existing users regardless of how they type their email.

The fix includes:
- Email normalization on save
- Case-insensitive lookups
- Comprehensive test coverage (36 tests)
- Security validation
- Documentation

**Status: READY FOR PRODUCTION ✓**
