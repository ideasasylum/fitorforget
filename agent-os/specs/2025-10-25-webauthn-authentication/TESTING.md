## Bug Fix Implemented

### Critical Bug Identified
**Issue:** The system was registering the same user repeatedly instead of allowing them to sign in when they entered their email with different casing (e.g., "User@Example.com" vs "user@example.com").

**Root Cause:**
1. SQLite's `find_by` performs case-sensitive lookups by default
2. The User model did not normalize emails before saving
3. The SessionsController used case-sensitive `find_by(email:)` to check for existing users

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added `before_validation :normalize_email` callback to User model
   - Normalizes all emails to lowercase and strips whitespace
2. Added `User.find_by_email(email)` class method
   - Performs case-insensitive lookups using `WHERE LOWER(email) = ?`
3. Updated SessionsController to use `User.find_by_email(email)` instead of `find_by(email:)`
   - Used in both `check` action (line 22) and `handle_authentication` method (line 145)

**Tests Validating Fix:**
- `test_full_login_flow_authenticates_existing_user_with_case-insensitive_email`
- `test_case-insensitive_email_lookup_prevents_duplicate_user_registrations`
- `test_user_model_normalizes_email_to_lowercase_before_saving`
- `test_find_by_email_finds_users_regardless_of_email_case`

## Test Coverage by Area

### Model Tests (19 tests)

#### User Model (12 tests)
- Email presence validation
- Email uniqueness validation (case-insensitive)
- Email format validation (must contain @)
- webauthn_id auto-generation on create
- has_many credentials association
- Cascade delete of credentials when user destroyed
- **NEW:** Email normalization to lowercase
- **NEW:** Whitespace stripping from email
- **NEW:** Case-insensitive find_by_email method
- **NEW:** find_by_email returns nil for non-existent/blank emails

#### Credential Model (7 tests)
- external_id presence validation
- public_key presence validation
- user_id presence validation
- external_id uniqueness validation
- belongs_to user association
- Default sign_count value of 0
- Custom sign_count values

### Controller Tests (5 tests)

#### SessionsController (5 tests)
- GET /auth renders auth form
- POST /auth/check returns registration challenge for new email
- POST /auth/check returns authentication challenge for existing email
- POST /auth/verify creates session (basic route test)
- DELETE /logout clears session and redirects

### Integration Tests (12 tests)

#### Critical Workflows Tested
1. **Full registration flow** - creates user, credential, and session
2. **Full login flow with case-insensitive email** - validates bug fix
3. **Multi-device registration** - multiple credentials per user
4. **Session persistence** - across multiple requests
5. **Logout flow** - clears session and redirects
6. **Authentication helper** - basic functionality
7. **Return-to redirect** - session value handling
8. **Email validation** - invalid format rejected
9. **Email validation** - empty email rejected
10. **Case-insensitive lookup** - prevents duplicate registrations (KEY BUG FIX TEST)
11. **Email normalization** - user model callback
12. **find_by_email method** - case-insensitive lookups

- [ ] Test WebAuthn unsupported browser message
- [ ] Test invalid email format error
- [ ] Test empty email error
- [ ] Test network error handling
- [ ] Test WebAuthn verification failure

### User Experience Testing
- [ ] Registration completes in under 30 seconds
- [ ] Login completes in under 10 seconds
- [ ] No jarring page refreshes (Turbo working)
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Mobile layout is comfortable on small screens
- [ ] Touch targets are large enough (min 44x44px)
- [ ] Font sizes prevent mobile zoom (min 16px)

## Security Validation Completed

See SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md for detailed security validation.

## Known Limitations

### WebAuthn Mocking in Tests
Full end-to-end WebAuthn credential verification is not mocked in automated tests due to complexity. Integration tests verify flow up to the WebAuthn step, but actual credential creation/verification requires manual device testing.

### Session Persistence in Integration Tests
Rails integration tests may handle sessions differently than real browsers. Session persistence is validated through manual browser testing.

## Test Execution Commands

### Run All Authentication Tests
```bash
bin/rails test test/models/user_test.rb test/models/credential_test.rb test/controllers/sessions_controller_test.rb test/integration/authentication_flows_test.rb
```

### Run Specific Test Files
```bash
# User model tests
bin/rails test test/models/user_test.rb

# Credential model tests
bin/rails test test/models/credential_test.rb

# Controller tests
bin/rails test test/controllers/sessions_controller_test.rb

# Integration tests
bin/rails test test/integration/authentication_flows_test.rb
```

### Run Specific Test
```bash
bin/rails test test/integration/authentication_flows_test.rb -n test_case-insensitive_email_lookup_prevents_duplicate_user_registrations
```

## Continuous Integration

All 36 tests should pass before deploying to production. The bug fix ensures users can sign in with any casing of their email address.
